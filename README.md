# Weather In The City

Project aims to create a simple CRUD app with several integrations with external Services.
It's MVP created in Blazor without taking huge load and scalability into consideration.

## Functional requirements:

- Store at least one type of entity
- Data must be stored in a database - Any type of database (e.g. SQL, MongoDB), excluding file systems, operating memory and browser store.
- Add a new entity.
- Edit an entity.
- Delete an entity.
- List all entities.
- At least one entity should have a unique identifier
- Use the following property types in your data models:
    - Date
    - String
    - Boolean
    - Number
- Fetch data dynamically from an external source â€“ for example weather forecast data, currency exchange rate. The fetched data should be processed and stored
  appropriately for further use within the application.
- Sorting
- Search
- Pagination

## Developer Guide:

Because app uses several external services, it might be hard to run it locally.

### Local Development

For local development it might be beneficial to deploy [Postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org.pl/) and [Seq](https://datalust.co/seq) via Docker.
Blazor app can run locally without Docker.

```bash
docker compose -f docker compose -f compose/compose-services-dev.yaml up -d seq postgres
```
```bash
dotnet run --project src/WeatherInTheCity/WeatherInTheCity.csproj
```

### Docker Setup

If you simply want to run the app and all needed services in Docker, you can use the following command.

```bash
docker compose -f docker compose -f compose/compose-services.yaml up -d
```

### Deployment

App can be easily deployed via [Portainer](https://www.portainer.io/) as well. Use [Business Edition](https://www.portainer.io/install) or [portainer-ee](https://hub.docker.com/r/portainer/portainer-ee) image.

Easiest way to serve app is to use [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) as web server.
